# RAG Terminologies

A comprehensive glossary of terms commonly used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and related AI/ML concepts.

## Core RAG Concepts

### **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
A technique that combines information retrieval with text generation, allowing AI models to access external knowledge sources to generate more accurate and up-to-date responses.

### **Retrieval**
The process of finding and extracting relevant documents or information from a knowledge base in response to a user query.

### **Augmentation**
The process of enhancing an AI model's response by incorporating retrieved external information into the generation process.

### **Generation**
The process of creating human-like text responses using language models, often enhanced with retrieved context.

## Document Processing

### **Document Loading**
The process of importing and parsing various file formats (PDFs, Word docs, web pages, etc.) into a format suitable for processing.

### **Text Splitting**
The technique of breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable chunks while preserving semantic meaning and context.

### **Chunking**
The process of dividing documents into smaller segments, typically used to fit within model context windows and improve retrieval precision.

### **Chunk Size**
The number of characters or tokens in each document segment, a critical parameter that affects retrieval quality and processing efficiency.

### **Chunk Overlap**
The amount of text shared between consecutive chunks, helping to maintain context and prevent information loss at chunk boundaries.

### **Embedding**
A numerical representation of text that captures semantic meaning, allowing for similarity comparisons and vector-based search.

### **Vector**
A mathematical representation of text as a list of numbers, enabling computational operations for similarity and retrieval tasks.

## Storage and Indexing

The process of organizing and structuring documents in a way that enables fast and efficient retrieval operations.

### **Vector Database**
A specialized database optimized for storing, indexing, and querying high-dimensional vector data for similarity search.

### **ChromaDB**
An open-source vector database designed specifically for AI applications, providing efficient similarity search and metadata filtering.

### **Pinecone**
A managed vector database service that provides scalable similarity search capabilities for AI applications.

### **Weaviate**

## Retrieval Methods

### **Similarity Search**
A technique that finds documents most similar to a query by comparing vector representations using distance metrics.

### **Cosine Similarity**
A measure of similarity between two vectors based on the cosine of the angle between them, commonly used in vector search.

### **Euclidean Distance**
A distance metric that measures the straight-line distance between two points in vector space.

### **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
An algorithm that finds the k most similar documents to a query by comparing vector distances.

### **Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)**
Algorithms that provide fast, approximate similarity search by sacrificing some accuracy for significant speed improvements.

### **Hybrid Search**
A retrieval approach that combines multiple search methods (e.g., vector similarity and keyword matching) for improved results.

## Ranking and Reranking

### **Ranking**
The initial process of ordering retrieved documents based on their relevance to a query using similarity scores.

### **Reranking**
A refined process that reorders initially retrieved documents using more sophisticated models to improve relevance accuracy.

### **Cross-Attention**
A mechanism in neural networks that allows models to focus on different parts of input sequences when processing queries and documents.

### **Relevance Score**
A numerical value indicating how well a document matches a query, used for ranking and filtering results.

## Query Processing

### **Query Expansion**
The technique of generating multiple related queries from an original query to improve retrieval coverage.

### **Query Reformulation**
The process of rewriting or modifying a user query to improve retrieval effectiveness.

### **Multi-Query Retrieval**
A strategy that uses multiple variations of a query to retrieve a broader set of relevant documents.

### **Query Understanding**
The process of analyzing and interpreting user queries to determine intent and extract key concepts.

## Context and Generation

### **Context Window**
The maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that a language model can process in a single input.

### **Context Compression**
The technique of reducing the size of retrieved context while preserving essential information.

### **Prompt Engineering**
The practice of designing effective prompts to guide language models in generating desired responses.

### **Few-Shot Learning**
A technique where models learn to perform tasks with minimal examples provided in the prompt.

### **Zero-Shot Learning**
The ability of models to perform tasks without any specific training examples for that task.

## Advanced Techniques

### **Multi-Modal RAG**
RAG systems that can process and retrieve information from multiple types of data (text, images, audio, etc.).

### **Structured Output**
The generation of responses in specific formats (JSON, XML, etc.) rather than free-form text.

### **Function Calling**
A technique where language models can invoke specific functions or APIs to perform actions or retrieve information.

### **Agent-Based RAG**
RAG systems that use autonomous agents to perform complex tasks involving multiple retrieval and generation steps.

### **Conversational RAG**
RAG systems designed to maintain context across multiple turns of conversation.

## Evaluation and Metrics

### **Retrieval Accuracy**
A measure of how well a retrieval system finds relevant documents for given queries.

### **Generation Quality**
The assessment of how well generated responses meet user needs in terms of accuracy, relevance, and coherence.

### **Hallucination**
The phenomenon where language models generate information that is not supported by the retrieved context or training data.

### **Grounding**
The process of ensuring that generated responses are based on retrieved information rather than the model's training data.

### **Citation**
The practice of referencing specific sources or documents that support generated responses.

## Performance and Optimization

### **Latency**
The time it takes for a RAG system to process a query and return a response.

### **Throughput**
The number of queries a RAG system can process per unit time.

### **Scalability**
The ability of a RAG system to handle increasing amounts of data and user requests efficiently.
